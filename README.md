## COVENANTS VIOLATION FREQUENCY AS A MACROECONOMIC INDICATOR 

Lenders use loan covenants, an early warning signal of financial distress, to protect their interests. Violations to these covenants are an event of default, and they typically happen before bankruptcy. We hypothesize that the aggregate frequency of firms violating loan covenants can serve as an early indicator of macroeconomic conditions. We test this hypothesis formally by examining whether violations are correlated with and proceed the delinquency rate and the charge-of rate on Commercial and Industrial Loans.

Examining disclosures in more than 400,000 quarterly reports with the SEC to measure violation frequency, we create a 20 years aggregated time series of violation frequency and use regression to eliminate seasonality and trend that is apparent in time series. We find a statistically significant positive correlation between violation frequency, delinquency rate and charge-off rate with a lag of three to four quarters. These results serve an indictor forecasting macroeconomic conditions.
